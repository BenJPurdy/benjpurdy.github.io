Game Engine Project
---
This was a capstone project for my university course, involving creating a game engine utilising middleware.
It contains a fully functional scripting system using C++ and w64devkit's portable C++ compiler and can be used to make games in 2d.
Scripts are injected into the game engine using a DLL, which is dynmaically compiled based on when file edit times, 
allowing for fast recompilation by only building the neccessary object files when at runtime.
It is currently being expanded on my own time to include textures and 3d rendering.
