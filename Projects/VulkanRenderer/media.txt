My Vulkan Renderer. The project is still very basic and has taken a back seat as I have focused more on university and game projects. The image texture used is made by me, using assets from the game Warframe.

Video demonstrating the renderer, showing the features currently implimented, including textures (texture shown is a fanart render of a Warframe from Warframe), use of multiple render systems and correctly ordered rendering for transparency.
